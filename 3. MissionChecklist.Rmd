# Mission Checklist

This document is a working checklist guide for UAS field missions using the Phantom 4 Pro for forest ecological applications


## Before going into the field
- Consult the Flight Planning document for planning the mission
- Consult the Equipment List and ensure all items are charged

## Field protocol - pre-mission tasks
- Put all UAS eqipment in a shaded spot if possible
- Lay out GCPs distributed throughout the AOI, placing some near the edges of the image and some on the interior in splots where they will be visible in the aerial imagery
- Measure the location of the GCPs and make any notes related to that
- Identify a good launch point and place any landing platform down
- Remove the sensor cover from the UAS
- Brush the snesor to clean it
- Check that an SD card is inserted
- Set the UAS on the landing platform
- Attach the propellers and make sure they are secure
- Check the battery's power and insert it, ensuring it is completely locked in
- Turn on the remote control and connect the iPhone or iPad using a cable
- Turn on the UAS after the remote control is on
- Open DJI Go and check the return to home height and any other global setting that are relevant
- Close DJI Go

## Field protocol - Executing the mission
- Consult the Flight Planning Map Pilot document for executing the mission

## Field protocol - post-mission tasks
- Once the UAS has safely landed, turn it off
- Turn off the remote control after the UAS is off
- Close Map Pilot and sleep the tablet if you'd like
- Remove the UAS battery and place it in a shaded spot
- Remove the sd card, replace it with a clean one, and transfer data
- If you are not flying another mission immediately: remove propeller blades and repack them, replace the sensor cover, and repack the UAS
- Once all missions in that AOI are completed, collect the GCPs and replace them with a permanant marker if desired for subsequent missions
